# Rave

Rave is a Python package that models the structure of astrophysical disks nonparametrically from images. 

Given an input image of an optically thin disk, Rave recovers the face-on surface brightness as a function of radius and vertical height of the disk as a function of radius if sufficiently edge-on. 

## Publication
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.04475.pdf) provides details of the algorithm and its performance for edge-on disks. 

[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08584.pdf) provides details on the updated algorithm optimised for more face-on disks. 

## Installation
Rave is available at [pypi.org/project/rave](https://pypi.org/project/rave/). We recommend installing via

`pip install rave`

## Demo
See ./demo for demos.
